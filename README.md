# simple-cpu
 creating a simple cpu with vhdl... learning all about testbenches and directory structure for cpu design and development pipelines. This project is a learning project aimed to be a started project in a cpu design leraning track, where the end result is writing cpu firmware like scheduler, memory manager, interface with the OS, drivers, and more... So this could be the pre-basics, then moving on we're gonnna have the basics of cpu design with a super basic fundamental simple as possible CPU of our creation, then we can add peripheral firmware to it like the memory manager and the interrupt handler and the drivers that will work wiht it and the scheduler and integrating data structures with vhdl itself and all that fancy development stuff. But the journey of a 1000 miles starts with a single step.
